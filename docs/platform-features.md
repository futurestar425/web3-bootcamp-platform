## Course Structure

Courses are organized into five key sections. Each section contains lessons with a specific area where students can enter their code. This setup is aimed at helping students fully understand the topics covered.

## Features and Offerings

- **NFT Certificates**: On course completion, participants receive an non-transferable NFT, viewable in our [OpenSea Collection](https://opensea.io/collection/web3dev-bootcamp).
- **Mentorship**: Graduates can become mentors, helping new students through their learning journey.

## Cohorts and Certification

- We offer both "Eternal" cohorts for asynchronous learning and event-based cohorts with live coding sessions.
- Courses typically last 10 days. Timely completion awards a cohort-specific NFT, while later completion grants an "Eternal" NFT for the course.

### NFT Certificates

Upon completing our courses, students are awarded unique NFT certificates. These digital certificates serve as a modern testament to your achievement and can be prominently displayed on professional networks like LinkedIn.

### Key Features of the NFT Certificates:

- Limited Traits: Each NFT certificate contains only three specific traits: the course name, the cohort, and the student's completion number. This tailored approach highlights the personalized journey of each learner.

- Dynamic SVG on Blockchain: The certificate is a dynamic SVG file stored directly on the blockchain. This innovative format allows for the certificate to evolve; new courses can be added simply by updating the aforementioned fields.

In the sample above, "ETERNOS" denotes the cohort, and the course title, in this instance, "SoliditySmartContract", is dynamically generated. This ensures that each certificate is not only a symbol of personal accomplishment but also a piece of art tailored to the individual's learning path.

## Multi-Language Support and Open-Source Content

Our platform is inclusive, supporting multi-language content to cater to a global audience. All course materials are open-source, accessible through markdown files in the `web3dev-version` branch of our [GitHub repository](https://github.com/w3b3d3v/buildspace-projects/tree/web3dev-version).
