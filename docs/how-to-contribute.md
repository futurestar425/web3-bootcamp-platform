## Getting Started

1. Fork the repository by clicking the "Fork" button on the GitHub page.
2. Clone your forked repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/<your-github-username>/web3-bootcamp-platform.git
   cd web3-bootcamp-platform
   ```

3. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   yarn install
   ```

4. Start the Firebase emulator:

   ```bash
   yarn emulator
   ```

5. Seed data to the local database, open a new terminal and run:

   ```bash
   yarn seed
   ```

6. Run the development server:
   ```bash

   ```

Open http://localhost:3000 with your favorite browser to see your project.

### Deploy to production

You can see the results locally in production mode with:

```
$ yarn build
$ yarn start
```

The generated HTML and CSS files are minified (built-in feature from Next js). It will also removed unused CSS from [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com).

Now, the plataform is ready to be deployed. All generated files are located at `build` folder, which you can deploy with any hosting service.
